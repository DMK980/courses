To answer these questions, a public kaggle data set of fit bit users will be used.
The data set comprises of multiple csv files but after a close inspection of the

## Findings  

After analyzing the data and gaining some insight on trends, i can go back and 
answer the business task questions confidently and with actionable insights 

#### 1. What are some trends in smart device usage?

The Trends that stook out to me are the fact that the evening time is when most
of the Total steps are accumulated as well as that for the majority of the time 
the participants are sedentary and most of the time are doing light exercises 
which could signal that maybe the device is more of a fashion statement for most
than a exercise aid. 


#### 2. How could these trends apply to Bella beat customers?

These Trends could apply to Bella beat customers by providing a newsletter or 
weekly email that would show the stats and give information on why they need to 
be more active for health benefits and reduce sedentary time 


#### 3. How could these trends help influence Bella beat marketing strategy?

For the Marketing Strategy the findings could help narrow down the target audience
for the campaign to a few factors 

- The Target audience does light exercise and is sedentary most of the time
- The exercise timing is mostly in the evenings after work time or before work
- The Average distance is around 3 to 5 KM with steps Averaging 7600~

With that information the marketing team knows the best times for the campaign to 
air as well as the target audience for the campaign.
