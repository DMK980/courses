# ðŸ“š Online Course Projects Repository

This repository serves as a collection of all the projects, exercises, and practice code I completed while taking various online courses.  
Each sub-folder represents a standalone project or component that I built as part of the learning process.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
The main goal of this repo is to:
- Track my progress across different courses.  
- Consolidate all small projects in one place.  
- Serve as a quick reference for concepts Iâ€™ve learned.  

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
Each folder inside this repository corresponds to a specific course project.  

## ðŸš€ Live Demos
Where possible, Iâ€™ve deployed these projects for easy preview.  
Links are provided in each projectâ€™s README (or below if available).  

## ðŸ’¡ Note
These projects are primarily for learning and practice. They are not production-level apps but showcase the concepts I was working on during my studies.
